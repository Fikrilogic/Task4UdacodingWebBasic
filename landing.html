                    <p>With increasing agricultural technology, it causes changes in people's lifestyle. especially in
                        the field of food which is the most important thing for everyone's life. So we came up with an
                        idea of how to create a website for farmers to connect them with customers. So this website was
                        born so that customers can get food directly from farmers at a fairly low price.</p>

                    <h3>Best Farmer Website on 2021</h3>
                    <p>Since the virus pandemic hit the whole world, everyone has started working at home and the local
                        government has prevented large numbers of people from congregating in one place. the market is
                        one place where many people are easily infected with the virus. <br>

                        With this website, they don't need to go to the market to buy the food they need. Only need to
                        order through this website, so they can order food directly from farmers without intermediaries
                        at low and healthy prices.</p>
